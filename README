This is a library to connect a display from an old DVD I found in a trash can to a Raspberry PI.

NOTE that the display grids an segments arrangement is valid for the particular display I have, you'll have to experiment with yours to find the correct setup.

The communication with the controller chip (PT6312) is done using the GPIO lines of Raspberry PI, using the bcm2835 library.
The GPIO lines to use are configured in pt6312.c file, by modifying these lines (if needed):

/* GPIO pins */
#define RO_PIN  RPI_GPIO_P1_15
#define CLK_PIN RPI_GPIO_P1_19
#define STB_PIN RPI_GPIO_P1_21
#define DIO_PIN RPI_GPIO_P1_23

The PT6312 chip works with 5v logic, so you'll need an interface to adapt the 3v3 levels of the Raspberry pi to those.
